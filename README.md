# Hi everyone ðŸ‘‹

## About Me

Hello, I'm an embedded systems engineer with over four years of experience in developing robust, maintainable firmware for embedded and IoT devices. I specialize in delivering high-quality solutions that are tailored to meet the unique needs of each project. 

## My Work Experience

* October 2022 - August 2024: Embedded Firmware Engineer at [ITR VN](https://www.linkedin.com/company/itr-vn/).
    - At ITR VN, I developed firmware for various medical device projects in Singapore and the US. My role involved architectural design, implementation, and rigorous testing to ensure these devices met the highest standards of quality, reliability, and robustness.

* April 2022 - October 2022: Embedded Firmware Engineer at [Samsung Electronics HCMC CE Complex](https://www.linkedin.com/company/samsung-electronics-hcmc-ce-complex/). 
   - At Samsung Electronics HCMC CE Complex, I designed and maintained firmware for consumer electronics, with a focus on monitors. My work included developing firmware for next-generation monitor products and maintaining firmware for existing models to ensure top-quality,reliability, and robustness.

* August 2020 - April 2022: Embedded Firmware Engineer at [EarableÂ® Neuroscience](https://www.linkedin.com/company/earableai/)
  - At EarableÂ® Neuroscience, a leader in advancing neuroscience for improved daily life, I contributed to the development of firmware for the EarableÂ® product. This wearable device monitors brain activity and provides real-time feedback, showcasing the innovative application of neuroscience in consumer technology.
 

## My Skill Set

* **Firmware Architecture Design**: A crucial step that many engineers overlook. Without a well-thought-out architecture, firmware can become extremely difficult to maintain and extend with new features.
* **Firmware Documentation**: Proper documentation is essential. Without it, others may waste time trying to understand and work with your firmware.
* **Firmware Testing**: Iâ€™m a strong advocate for automated testing, as it is key to delivering high-quality firmware.
* **Programming Languages**: I am fluent in embedded C and C++. I also have experience with Python, which I use for scripting and testing.
